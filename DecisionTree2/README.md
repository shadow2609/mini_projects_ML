2nd Basic Project with Decission Tree

Project Objective
We are going to use the same project we started in Project 10. We have implemented the project so far using Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM with linear kernel, SVM with rbf kernel and Naive Bayes classifier.

Letâ€™s explore our dataset. It shows which users have purchased an iPhone. Our objective in this project is to predict if the customer will purchase an iPhone or not given their gender, age and salary.
