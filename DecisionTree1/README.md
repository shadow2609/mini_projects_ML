First ML Mini Project: Basic Decision Tree
This is a small and basic Machine Learning (ML) project aimed at introducing beginners to decision tree classifiers. The project uses a made-up CSV dataset to keep it simple and easy to understand.

Project Description
In this project, I implemented a basic decision tree classifier using Python's Scikit-learn library. The decision tree algorithm is a popular and intuitive choice for classification tasks. The dataset used is a synthetic CSV dataset with a few features and a binary target variable. I've also trained and tested the model with its accuracy score and visualized the decision tree using graphviz.

Happy learning! ðŸŒŸ
